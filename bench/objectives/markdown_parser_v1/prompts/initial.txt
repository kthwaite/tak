You are implementing an objective inside a fresh git repository.

Objective:
- Implement a mini Markdown renderer in Python.
- Main API: render_markdown(text: str) -> str
- Add/complete CLI support in src/markdown.py
- Make tests pass.

Rules:
- Use Python stdlib only.
- Prefer natural usage of `tak` for planning/tracking work.
- Keep task states truthful as you work.
- Do NOT directly edit `.tak/tasks/*.json`, `.tak/learnings/*.json`, `.tak/history/*.jsonl`, or `.tak/counter*.json` by hand.
- Use git with frequent atomic commits.

Notes:
- Hidden tests exist.
- Additional requirements may arrive mid-run.

When you believe the INITIAL requirement set is complete, print this token on its own line:
TAKBENCH_PHASE1_DONE

When all requirements (including any mid-run updates) are complete, print this token on its own line:
TAKBENCH_FINAL_DONE
