Requirement update:

Please extend the parser to support ordered lists.

New behavior:
- Consecutive lines matching `^[0-9]+\.\s+` should render as an ordered list:
  - `1. one\n2. two` ->
    <ol>
    <li>one</li>
    <li>two</li>
    </ol>
- Ordered lists are block-level, similar to unordered lists.
- Inline formatting still applies inside list items.
- HTML escaping still applies to text nodes.

Please update your plan/tasks naturally in `tak`, implement the change, verify via tests, and commit your changes.

When fully done, print:
TAKBENCH_FINAL_DONE
