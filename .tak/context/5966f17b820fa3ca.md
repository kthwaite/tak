Updated contributor docs for workspace crate split:

- `README.md`: added "Workspace layout (for contributors)" section with crate boundaries (`tak-core` vs `tak-cli`) and targeted verification command matrix.
- `CLAUDE.md`: updated Build/Test command section for workspace usage; added explicit "Workspace crate layout" guidance and clarified that feature behavior should be added under `crates/tak-core/src/...`.
- `docs/how/workspace-architecture.md`: new focused how-to covering crate boundaries, code placement rules, and workspace verification workflow.
- `docs/how/README.md`: linked the new workspace architecture page.

No codepath changes in this slice; documentation-only update aligned to crate split migration state.
