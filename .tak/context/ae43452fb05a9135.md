Added lightweight rollout guidance in `docs/plans/2026-02-11-crate-split-rollout-notes.md` covering:
- current migration state snapshot
- expected break windows
- fast roll-forward loop with explicit verification commands
- quick rollback handle
- multi-agent coordination etiquette during high-churn file moves

Aligned to low-ceremony, fast-moving rollout posture for this epic.
