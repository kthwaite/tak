Completed module-coupling/entrypoint inventory in `docs/plans/2026-02-11-crate-split-inventory.md`.

Highlights captured:
- current single-package topology and LOC distribution
- command dispatch flow from `main::run()`
- module ownership map (cli/app/domain/store/metrics/output)
- explicit clap coupling hotspots outside main
- execution/presentation coupling via `Format` in command handlers
- extraction implications aligned with kickoff decisions (core owns output/functional behavior; cli stays parse+process wrapper).
