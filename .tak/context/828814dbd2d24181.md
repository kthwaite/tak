Drafted API/layering contract in `docs/plans/2026-02-11-tak-core-api-contract.md`.

Key outputs:
- explicit tak-core vs tak-cli responsibility split aligned to kickoff decisions
- proposed `execute(request) -> Result<ExecuteResponse, TakError>` core facade shape
- error-boundary contract (`thiserror` in core, `anyhow` at CLI boundary)
- forbidden dependency directions/layering rules
- dependency partition guidance and test split contract
- fast-path migration posture and non-goals (internal-only API first).
