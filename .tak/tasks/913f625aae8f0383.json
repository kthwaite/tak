  "description": "Refactor tak into a multi-crate workspace where `tak-core` owns domain, storage, lifecycle, and command execution logic while `tak-cli` becomes a thin CLI adapter focused on argument parsing, output selection, and process exit semantics.",

      "Workspace includes `tak-core` (library crate) and `tak-cli` (binary crate) with documented module ownership boundaries.",
      "All command execution paths used by `tak-cli` flow through stable `tak-core` APIs rather than direct command-module coupling.",
      "Behavior/output parity is preserved for existing command surfaces via regression coverage.",
      "Architecture and migration docs explain crate boundaries and contributor workflow."
