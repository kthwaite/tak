  "description": "Capture and document agreed decisions: keep output policy in core, keep CLI-only features in tak-cli, move functional behavior to tak-core, use thiserror in tak-core + anyhow in tak-cli, concentrate most tests in tak-core with CLI smoke/contracts, keep setup/doctor/plugin paths unchanged initially, and keep tak-core internal-only (no versioned public API yet). Also record optional future tak-app split as non-blocking spike.",
