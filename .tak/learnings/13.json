  "description": "A low-risk first step for single-crate-to-workspace migration is to keep the existing root package untouched, add `[workspace]` members, and introduce compile-only scaffold crates with path deps. This keeps existing `cargo test -p <root>` entrypoints stable while opening a landing zone for later moves.",
