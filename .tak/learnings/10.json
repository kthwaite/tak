  "description": "For single-crate Rust CLIs, a fast architecture inventory should include (1) LOC distribution by module family, (2) grep of `clap::ValueEnum` derives outside main, and (3) scan for output/printing calls in command handlers. This quickly identifies where CLI concerns leak into core and defines extraction order with less churn.",
